        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">Enable users to create accounts and securely log in.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Allow users to search for and review books.</li>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Development Steps</h2>

        <h3>1. Setting Up the Development Environment</h3>
        <p>The project was developed on an Ubuntu server hosted on AWS, setting up Node.js, MySQL, and other necessary packages for server-side functionality and the database.</p>

        <h3>2. Designing the Database Schema</h3>
        <p>The database was created with tables for storing user information, book details, and user reviews. Key tables include:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>userData:</strong> Stores user account details.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>userBooks:</strong> Stores book titles, ISBNs, and metadata.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>userRatings:</strong> Stores user reviews, ratings, and relevant book information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Implementing User Authentication</h3>
        <p>User authentication was implemented using sessions to ensure secure access to the platform, including login, registration, and session management to keep users logged in across requests.</p>

        <h3>4. Creating APIs for Book and Review Management</h3>
        <p>RESTful APIs were built using Express.js for handling book data and user reviews. Routes were created for submitting reviews, retrieving book data, and accessing user-specific content.</p>

        <h3>5. Developing the Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering and the KNN algorithm to suggest books based on user ratings by:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">Collecting and analyzing user rating data.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Calculating similarity between users to provide relevant book recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Integrating the Google Books API</h3>
        <p>To enrich book information, the Google Books API was integrated. When users click on book titles, detailed information is retrieved and displayed, with an option to submit reviews.</p>

        <h3>7. Designing the Front-End Interface</h3>
        <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create a user-friendly front end, including main pages such as the login page, user dashboard, and review submission page.</p>

        <h3>8. Testing and Deployment</h3>
        <p>After development, the project was tested to ensure all features work as expected. Finally, it was deployed for users online.</p>
